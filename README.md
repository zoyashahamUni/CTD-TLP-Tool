# Zoya's CTD + Temporal Logic (nuXmv) Project

This repository is using nuXmv to integrate Combinatorial Test Design (CTD) with Temporal Logic
for model-based testing using **nuXmv**.

**Structure**
- `model/` – nuXmv models (the shopping cart system)
- `tool/` – CTD and property generation tools
- `output/` – run results and traces (ignored by Git)
- `archive/` – older or experimental versions

The nuXmv binaries are not committed.
